BarChart.py
This script was written to be used in ArcGIS to create a Geoprocessing tool to be used in ArcGIS Software. The tool is meant to create a Bar Chart for visualization of Quantitative data in a Thematic Map.

The Softwares used were PyCharm and ArcGIS

Some issues faced in this project was due to not being to use some Python libraries in the ArcGIS Software. The creation of the BarChart has to be done using some calculations.
